Generates a random password based on user inputs, ie 
  
  - How many characters is the password
  - How many alphabets does the password use
  - How many digits does the password use

  - Total characters        = 30
  - Alphabetical characters = 10
  - Digits                  = 10
  - Special characters      = 10
